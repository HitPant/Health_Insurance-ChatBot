              "'Insurance\\nhow insurance  \\nworksHealth insurance is one of the best ways you can protect yourself \\nand your family in case you get sick or injured and need medical \\ncare. It also helps you get the regular medical and dental care \\nyou need to stay healthy. With health insurance, you don’t have \\nto put off checkups, use the emergency room for everyday \\nhealth needs, or go to community health clinics with long wait \\ntimes. You can take care of your health today, instead of waiting \\nuntil you have a health emergency. Thanks to the Affordable Care \\nAct (ACA), millions of people can now afford health insurance.\\nThe ACA also rules that everyone in the United States must have \\nhealth insurance. If you don’t buy health insurance, you may \\nhave to pay extra in your taxes as a penalty.\\nwhy health insurance  \\nis important1\\nHealth insurance is a signed contract with a \\nhealth insurance company that requires the \\ncompany to pay for some of your health care \\ncosts. \\nThat doesn’t mean they will pay for everything. \\nYou will still have a responsibility to pay some \\ncosts, like your monthly premiums and your \\ncopays when you visit the doctor.\\nWith health insurance, you can see the doctor \\nwhen you need to, whether that means regular \\ncheckups to stay healthy or when you’re sick.\\nNow you can buy health insurance through \\nthe Health Insurance Marketplace. \\nThe Health Insurance Marketplace (also called \\nHealth Exchanges in some states) is a new \\nway to help you find and buy insurance. The \\ninsurance covers more of your medical needs, \\nincluding visits to the doctor to help you stay \\nhealthy. \\nThe insurance may be more affordable, with \\ndifferent plans to choose from depending on \\nwhat medical care you think you’ll need. You \\nmight also qualify for tax credits from the \\ngovernment that can help make your health \\ninsurance even less expensive. \\nPeople with health insurance are better able \\nto take care of their health. They can afford \\nregular check-ups so little health problems \\ndon’t turn into big ones. With health insurance \\nyou don’t have to go to crowded community \\nclinics, or wait a long time for medical care. \\nYou get better and faster care to help you stay \\nhealthier.What Is Health Insurance? Do you have questions \\nabout your insurance \\noptions? You can always \\nlook for and find local \\nassistance on the \\nMarketplace website at:  \\n \\nwww.localhelp  \\nhealthcare.gov\\n2\\nThere are different types of programs that \\npeople can be eligible for. Many people \\nreceive health insurance through their job \\nas a benefit. They may pay a small cost each \\nmonth for their insurance, or no cost at all, \\ndepending on the company they work for. \\nOther people receive Medicaid, which is \\ninsurance from the state. There are also other \\nhealth insurance programs, like Medicare, \\nwhich is for seniors age 65 or older, or the \\nChildren’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), \\nwhich is specifically for children. These \\nprograms have special requirements. \\nPeople who don’t get insurance through their \\njob, Medicaid, Medicare or CHIP have to buy \\nit on their own. It used to be very expensive, \\nand sometimes it didn’t pay for enough care. Health Insurance Programs\\nHEALTH INSURANCE  \\nTHROUGH WORK\\nMEDICAID\\nMEDICARE\\nCHILDREN’S HEALTH INSURANCE \\nPROGRAM\\nPRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE YOU \\nPURCHASE ON YOUR OWN\\nIf you or someone you \\nknow has questions \\nabout the Marketplace, \\nyou have the right to get \\nhelp and information \\nin your language at \\nno cost. To talk to an \\ninterpreter, call the \\nMarketplace at  \\n1-800-318-2596. 3\\nThe ACA changed how health insurance works. Some of the changes are:\\n> Parents can keep their children on their health insurance plans until they \\nturn 26 years old.\\n> Insurance companies cannot turn down people who already have \\nmedical conditions, sometimes called “pre-existing conditions.” Before, \\na company could decide not to insure someone because they had a \\nmedical condition like diabetes, or because they had cancer in the past. \\nNow, everyone must be accepted.\\n> Insurance companies cannot cancel people’s insurance plans if they get \\nsick.\\n> Insurance companies cannot set a limit on how many medical bills they \\nwill pay for someone on their insurance plan.\\n> Preventive care is now free. Your insurance cannot charge you for doctor \\nvisits for babies, vaccinations, annual check-ups, screenings and other \\ncare that helps you stay healthy.\\n> You can buy your insurance in the Health Insurance Marketplace \\n(Marketplace). Before, if your job didn’t give you health insurance, you \\nhad to buy it on your own and it was usually very expensive.\\n> Health insurance plans now have to cover a certain amount of care. \\nBefore, each company made their own decisions about what they would \\npay for and to what amount.What Has Changed in Health Insurance\\n4\\nThe ACA also makes sure that all health \\ninsurance plans offer the following benefits, \\nknown as essential health benefits. Every \\nhealth insurance plan now must give you at \\nleast these benefits: \\n> care you get without being admitted to \\na hospital (known as ambulatory patient \\nservices)\\n> emergency room care\\n> hospital care\\n> pregnancy and newborn care\\n> mental health and substance use care \\n> prescription drugs\\n> rehabilitative and habilitative services and \\ndevices\\n> laboratory services\\n> preventive and wellness services and \\nchronic disease management\\n> pediatric services, including oral and vision \\ncare.Essential Health Benefits\\n Every year there will \\nbe an open enrollment \\nperiod for individuals \\nto sign up for health \\ninsurance. Learn more at \\nwww.healthcare.gov.5\\n> SCREENINGS.  Checking to \\nsee if people have high blood \\npressure, depression or other \\nmedical issues that might cause \\nserious health problems. If these \\nare caught early, treatment is \\neasier and may work better.\\n> WOMEN’S HEALTH.  Health \\nservices for women such as \\nmammograms, checking for \\ncervical cancer, and providing \\nbirth control. > CHILDREN’S HEALTH.  Health \\nservices for children such as \\nchecking for autism, checking \\nhearing in newborn babies \\nand vision in children as they \\ngrow older, and giving them \\nvaccinations.\\n> MEN’S HEALTH. Health services \\nfor men such as colon cancer \\nscreenings and screenings for \\nuse of aspirin to prevent heart \\ndisease.Preventive Care\\nPreventive care means care that helps you stay healthy. These are services \\nthat prevent or help you from getting sick. It’s also better for your health \\nand your enjoyment of life. No one wants to be sick. \\nBecause of this, the ACA has a rule that states health insurance must now \\nalways include free preventive care. \\nA good example of preventive care is vaccinations. When you get a flu shot \\nduring flu season, that means you will not get the flu, or you will be less sick \\nif you do get it.\\nBecause vaccinations are preventive care, your health insurance will pay \\n100% of the cost, so your vaccines are free.\\nOther types of preventive care are:6\\nPremiums and Copays\\nPremiums and copays are two \\ndifferent types of costs that are \\npart of having health insurance and \\nhealth care.\\nA PREMIUM  is the amount \\nyou pay each month to your \\ninsurance company in order to \\nhave insurance. When you buy car \\ninsurance, for example, you pay the \\ninsurance company each month, \\nand health insurance is the same. If \\nyou don’t pay your health insurance \\npremium, your health insurance will \\nbe cancelled.\\nA COPAY  (short for copayment) \\nis a set amount of money you \\nhave to pay each time you need medical care—for example, if you \\nsee a doctor, get lab tests, or go to \\nthe hospital. Different plans have \\ndifferent copays. Some have no \\ncopay at all, while in some cases \\nyou may have to pay $10 or $25. For \\nlab visits, other tests, emergency \\nroom visits or hospital stays there \\nwill be other copays.\\nWhen you choose which insurance \\nplan you want to buy, part of your \\nchoice is about whether you want \\nlow or high monthly premiums \\nand copays. Each person or family \\ndecides what plan is best for them \\nbased on how often they think they \\nwill need medical care.\\nPAYING A COPAY AT THE \\nDOCTOR’S OFFICEPAYING YOUR MONTHLY \\nPREMIUM BILL AT HOME\\n7\\nDeductibles and Co-insurance\\nDEDUCTIBLES\\nSome insurance plans have a deductible. This is a set amount of money \\nthat you must pay before the insurance company starts to pay for certain \\nservices. When you have a high deductible, your health insurance premium \\n(your monthly bill for health insurance) is often smaller. Some people \\nchoose a high deductible if they think they will not need a lot of medical \\ncare, because then their monthly payments are lower. Once you reach your \\ndeductible for the year, then your insurance company may pay for a larger \\npart of your health care costs. The graphic below may help you understand \\nthis better.\\nCO-INSURANCE\\nDepending on your insurance plan, your insurance might only pay a \\npercentage or a part of your health care cost. For example, if your insurance \\npays 80% of x-ray costs, and your x-ray is $100, your insurance will pay \\n$80 and you pay $20. Some people choose to pay more for their monthly \\npremium so they have lower or no co-insurance costs. \\nhigh  \\ndeductible\\nhigher  \\ncopays  \\nand  \\nco-insurance\\nlower  \\ncopays  \\nand  \\nco-insurancehigh  \\npremium\\nlow  \\npremiumlow  \\ndeductible\\nHIGH-DEDUCTIBLE PLANS HIGH-PREMIUM PLANS8\\nHow Deductibles Work\\nTo understand how deductibles work, here is an example of a person \\nnamed John. John has a $500 deductible. Before John’s insurance pays \\n100% of some services, John will have to pay $500 from his own pocket.\\nFIRST MEDICAL VISIT\\nJohn must pay $100 for x-rays. He \\nstill has $400 left in his deductible.\\nSECOND MEDICAL VISIT\\nJohn pays a $20 copay (this doesn’t \\napply to his deductible).\\nTHIRD MEDICAL VISIT\\nJohn gets blood taken for tests and \\npays $125.\\nFOURTH MEDICAL VISIT\\nJohn has an emergency and pays \\n$275 at the ER.\\nDEDUCTIBLE IS NOW ZERO\\nWhen John pays all of his \\ndeductible, certain services will now \\nbe covered at 100%. For example, \\nif he has to get another x-ray he \\nwould not pay for it.\\n$500\\n– $100\\n$400\\n– $125\\n$275\\n– $275\\n0\\n$500  \\nDeductible\\nEach plan is different, so it’s important to review all of the details.9\\nFIRST MEDICAL VISIT\\nJohn must pay $100 for x-rays.\\nSECOND MEDICAL VISIT\\nJohn pays a $20 copay.\\nTHIRD MEDICAL VISIT\\nJohn gets blood taken for tests and \\npays $125.\\nFOURTH MEDICAL VISIT\\nJohn has an emergency and pays \\n$275 at the ER.\\nFIFTH MEDICAL VISIT\\nJohn is admitted to the hospital. \\nHis bills total over $10,000, but he \\nonly pays $480 of it because he has \\nreached his $1,000 out-of-pocket \\nmaximum. \\n0\\n+ $100\\n$100\\n+ $20\\n$120  \\n+ $125\\n$245\\n+ $275\\n$520\\n+ $480\\n$1,000How Out-of-Pocket Maximums Work\\nEach insurance plan has an out-of-pocket maximum—a limit to how much \\nyou have to pay for health care in a year. After you reach the maximum, you \\ndon’t have to pay that part of the costs anymore. The example below can \\nhelp you understand better.\\nBEFORE FIRST EXPENSE\\nAt the beginning of the year, John \\nhas spent zero towards his $1,000 \\nout-of-pocket maximum.\\n$1,000  \\nOut-of Pocket Maximum10\\nNetworks\\nYour health insurance company works with a group of doctors, hospitals, \\npharmacies and laboratories. They have an agreement about how much \\nthey charge, and they can be in one area of your state or in states nearby. \\nThis group is called a network. \\nSEEING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN NETWORK\\nWhen you sign up with a health insurance company, it is recommended that \\nyou see health care providers who are in that insurance company’s network. \\nThat means those health care providers accept your insurance plan. If you \\nwant to get health care outside that network you may have to pay for it on \\nyour own. That’s why, if you already have a doctor, hospital or other medical \\nprovider that you want to use, you should make sure they are in a health \\ninsurance company’s network before you choose that insurance plan. \\nSEEING OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS\\nSome insurance plans will allow you to go see an out-of-network provider by \\npaying more for the appointment, but it is up to you to check if your doctor \\nreceives your insurance. The next page provides more information about \\nthe different types of health insurance plans available.\\nYour Insurance \\nCompany’s Network  \\n(In Network)\\ndoctors  \\npharmacies  \\nlaboratories  \\nhospitals  \\nclinicsAll Other Health Care Providers (Out of Network)\\nmore expensiveless expensive11\\nTypes of Health Insurance Plans\\nHMO\\n(Health Maintenance Organization)\\nand \\nEPO  \\n(Exclusive Provider Organization)PPO   \\n(Preferred Provider Organization) \\nand  \\nPOS (Point-of-Service Plan)\\nWhen you choose an HMO or EPO \\ninsurance plan, your insurance will \\nonly pay for doctors, hospitals and \\nother care if they are part of your \\ninsurance plan’s network. If you \\nwant to use a different doctor or \\nhospital, you will have to pay for it \\nyourself. \\nHMOs also usually make you \\nget a referral from your main \\ndoctor to see a specialist like an \\nendocrinologist or therapist, but \\nEPOs usually do not.With these plans, you can choose \\nany doctor or hospital. If you pick \\nones that are part of the insurance \\nplan’s network, it will cost less. \\nWith PPO plans, you can visit any \\ndoctor without getting a referral. If \\nyou have a POS plan, you can visit \\nany doctor within the plan without \\na referral, but doctors outside the \\nplan do need a referral. \\nHDHP  \\n(High Deductible Health Plan)  Catastrophic  \\nPlan\\nHDHPs usually have low premiums \\nand high deductibles compared \\nto other plans. With an HDHP , you \\ncan use a health savings account \\nor a health reimbursement \\narrangement to pay for some \\nmedical costs. This means that \\nyour employer takes some of your \\npaycheck and puts it into a special \\nsavings account. When you need \\nmoney for medical care, you can \\ntake it from that account.People under age 30 or who have \\nhardship exemptions may be able \\nto buy a “catastrophic” plan. This \\nplan mainly protects you from very \\nhigh medical costs in the case of \\na major injury, such as from a car \\naccident. The monthly premiums \\nare low but the deductibles are \\nhigh.12\\nThe Marketplace helps people buy health insurance and find out if they \\ncan qualify for tax benefits, also known as subsidies, that will make health \\ninsurance less expensive.\\nWORKING WITH NAVIGATORS OR  \\nCERTIFIED APPLICATION COUNSELORS\\nYou can apply for health insurance through the Marketplace on your own, \\neither on the phone or on the internet. But because applying for insurance \\ncan sometimes be confusing, there are people who are trained to help you, \\nsuch as Navigators or Certified Application Counselors (CACs), who work \\nwith the Marketplace to help you understand your choices. They can help \\nyou apply. They can help you figure out what the costs will be, based on how \\nmuch money you earn and how many people are in your family. They can \\nalso answer your questions about how health insurance works and how it \\ncan help you.\\nAPPLYING FOR INSURANCE\\nThe application for health insurance through the Marketplace will ask you \\nabout how much money you earn, how many people are in your family, \\nwhere you live, what expenses you have and more. This will help you figure \\nout how much you can afford to pay for health insurance, and if you’re eligible \\nfor tax credits to make your insurance cost less. Your Navigator or CAC can tell \\nyou about the documents to bring to your meeting, such as pay stubs from \\nyour job, your tax return, or immigration documents. It takes about one hour \\nto fill out the application with the help of the Navigator or CAC.Applying for Insurance\\n13\\nPaying for Your Health Insurance\\nYou will need to pay an insurance \\nbill each month in order to keep \\nyour insurance. Health insurance \\nshould now be part of your monthly \\nbudget. Just like you pay rent and \\nutilities, you must also pay for \\nyour health insurance, or it will be \\ncancelled. If this happens and you \\nneed to see a doctor or get other \\nmedical care, you will have to pay \\nthe entire amount yourself.  \\nA few days after you sign up for \\nhealth insurance through the \\nMarketplace, you will receive your first bill. This will come from your \\nnew insurance company and it \\nwill tell you how much to pay. This \\namount should be the same as the \\namount you agreed to when you \\nsigned up. \\nIf you have questions about your \\ninsurance in the future, like how \\nmuch things will cost or who your \\ndoctor will be, call your insurance \\ncompany, not the Marketplace. \\nDon’t be afraid to ask for help from \\na Navigator, CAC, or your insurance \\ncompany.\\nRemember that health insurance is a contract that you sign with the health \\ninsurance company. Signing up for health insurance is the first step. Your \\nnext step is paying for it. 2000 N. Beauregard Street, 6th Floor\\nAlexandria, VA 22311\\nToll-free: 800-969-6642\\nmentalhealthamerica.netAbout Mental Health America\\nMental Health America (www.mentalhealthamerica.net), founded in 1909, is the nation’s \\nleading community-based network dedicated to helping all Americans achieve wellness \\nby living mentally healthier lives. With our 240 affiliates across the country, we touch the \\nlives of millions—Advocating for changes in mental health and wellness policy; Educating \\nthe public & providing critical information; and delivering urgently needed mental health \\nand wellness Programs and Services.\\nThis project was supported by Funding Opportunity \\nNumber CA-NAV-13-001 from the U.S. Department of Health and \\nHuman Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\\nThe contents provided are solely the responsibility of the authors and do  \\nnot necessarily represent the official views of HHS or any of its agencies.How U.S. Health \\nInsurance Works  \\nMain content start  \\nHealth care in the United States can be very \\nexpensive.  A single doctor’s office visit may cost \\nseveral hundred dollars and an average three -\\nday hospital stay can run tens of thousands of \\ndollars (or even more) depending on the type of \\ncare provided. Most of us could not afford to pay \\nsuch large sums if we get sick, especially since \\nwe don’t know when we might become ill or \\ninjured or how much care we might need. Health \\ninsurance offers a way to reduce such costs to \\nmore reasonable amounts.  \\n \\n  \\nThe way it typically works is that the consumer (you) pays an up front \\npremium to a health insurance company and that payment allows you to \\nshare \"risk\" with lots of other people (enrollees) who are making similar \\npayments. Since most people are healthy mo st of the time, the premium \\ndollars paid to the insurance company can be used to cover the expenses \\nof the (relatively) small number of enrollees who get sick or are injured. \\nInsurance companies, as you can imagine, have studied risk extensively, \\nand their  goal is to collect enough premium to cover medical costs of the \\nenrollees. There are many, many different types of health insurance plans \\nin the U.S. and many different rules and arrangements regarding care.  \\n \\nFollowing are three \\nimportant questions you \\nshould ask when making a \\ndecision about the health \\ninsurance that will work best \\nfor you.  \\n \\nKey Question 1  \\nWhere can I receive care?  \\nOne way that health insurance plans control their costs is to influence \\naccess to providers. Providers include physicians, hospitals, laboratories, \\npharmacies, and other entities. Many insurance companies contract with a \\nspecified network of providers that  has agreed to supply services to plan \\nenrollees at more favorable pricing.  \\nIf a provider is not in a plan’s network, the insurance company may not \\npay for the service(s) provided or may pay a smaller portion than it would \\nfor in -network care. This means the enrollee who goes outside of the \\nnetwork for care may be required to pay a much higher share of the cost. \\nThis is an important concept to understand, especially if you are not \\noriginally from the local Stanford area.  \\nIf you have a plan through a parent, for example, and that plan’s network \\nis in your hometown, you may not be able to get the care you need in the \\nStanford area, or you may incur much higher costs to get that care.  \\n \\nKey Question 2  \\nWhat does the plan cover?  \\nOne of the things health care reform has done in the U.S. (under the \\nAffordable Care Act) is to introduce more standardization to insurance \\nplan benefits. Before such standardization, the benefits offered varied \\ndrastically from plan to plan. For example, some plans covered \\nprescriptions, others did not. Now, plans in the U.S. are required to offer a \\nnumber of \"essential health benefits\" which include  \\nEmergency services  \\nHospitalization  \\nLaboratory tests  \\nMaternity and newborn care  \\nMental health and substance -abuse treatment  \\nOutpatient care (doctors and other services you receive outside of a \\nhospital)  \\nPediatric services, including dental and vision care  \\nPrescription drugs  \\nPreventive services (e.g., some immunizations) and management of \\nchronic diseases  \\nRehabilitation services  \\nFor our international population of students who might be considering \\ncoverage through a non U.S. based plan, asking the question, \"what does \\nthe plan cover\" is extremely important.   \\n \\nKey Question 3  \\nHow much will it cost?   \\nUnderstanding what insurance coverage costs is actually quite \\ncomplicated. In our overview, we talked about paying a premium to enroll \\nin a plan. This is an up front cost that is transparent to you (i.e., you know \\nhow much you pay).  \\nUnfortunately, for most plans, this is not the only cost associated with the \\ncare you receive. There is also typically cost when you access care. Such \\ncost is captured as deductibles, coinsurance, and/or copays (see \\ndefinitions below) and represents the sh are you pay out of your own pocket when you receive care. As a general rule of thumb, the more you \\npay in premium up front, the less you will pay when you access care. The \\nless you pay in premium, the more you will pay when you access care.  \\nThe question for our students is, pay (a larger share) now or pay (a larger \\nshare) later?  Either way, you will pay the cost for care you receive. We have \\ntaken the approach that it is better to pay a larger share in the upfront \\npremium to minimize, as much  as possible, costs that are incurred at the \\ntime of service. The reason for our thinking is that we don’t want any \\nbarrier to care, such as a high copay at the time of service, to discourage \\nstudents from getting care. We want students to access medical c are \\nwhenever it’s needed.  \\nImportant Insurance Terms and \\nConcepts  \\n• Out -of-pocket expenses : The terms \"out -of-pocket cost\" and/or \\n\"cost sharing\" refer to the portion of your medical expenses you are \\nresponsible for paying when you actually receive health care. The \\nmonthly premium you pay for care is separate from these costs.  \\n• Annual deductible : The annual deductible is amount you pay each \\nplan year before the insurance company starts paying its share of \\nthe costs. If the deductible is $2,000, then you would responsible for \\npaying the first $2,000 in health care you receive each year, after \\nwhic h the insurance company would start paying its share.  \\n• Copayment (or \\'Copay\\') : The copay is a fixed, upfront amount you \\npay each time you receive care when that care is subject to a copay. \\nFor example, a copay of $30 might be applicable for a doctor visit, \\nafter which the insurance company picks up the rest. Plans with \\nhigher premi ums generally have lower copays and vice versa. Plans \\nthat do not have copays typically use other methods of cost sharing.  \\n• Coinsurance : Coinsurance is a percentage of the cost of your \\nmedical care. For an MRI that costs $1,000, you might pay 20 percent \\n($200). Your insurance company will pay the other 80 percent ($800). \\nPlans with higher premiums typically have less coinsurance.  • Annual out -of-pocket maximum : The annual out -of-pocket \\nmaximum is the most cost -sharing you will be responsible for in a \\nyear. It is the total of your deductible, copays, and coinsurance (but \\ndoes not include your premiums). Once you hit this limit, the \\ninsurance company will pick up  100 percent of your  covered  costs \\nfor the remainder of the plan year. Most enrollees never reach the \\nout-of-pocket limit but it can happen if a lot of costly treatment for a \\nserious accident or illness is needed. Plans with higher premiums \\ngenerally have lower out -of-pocket limits.  \\n• What is means to be a \\'Covered Benefit\\' : The terms \\'covered \\nbenefit\\' and \\'covered\\' are used regularly in the insurance industry, \\nbut can be confusing. A \\'covered benefit\\' generally refers to a health \\nservice that is included (i.e., \\'covered\\') under the premium for a \\ngiven health insurance polic y that is paid by, or on behalf of, the \\nenrolled patient. \\'Covered\\' means that some portion of the \\nallowable cost of a health service will be considered for payment by \\nthe insurance company. It does not mean that the service will be \\npaid at 100%.  \\no For example, in a plan under which \\'urgent care\\' is \\'covered\\', a \\ncopay might apply. The copay os an out -of-pocket expense for \\nthe patient. If the copay is $100, the patient has to pay this \\namount (usually at the time of service) and then the insurance \\nplan  \\'covers\\' the rest of the allowed cost for the urgent care \\nservice.  \\no In some instances, an insurance company might not pay \\nanything toward a \\'covered benefit\\'. For example, if a patient \\nhas not yet met an annual deductible of $1,000, and the cost of \\nthe covered health service provided is $400, the patient will \\nneed to pay t he $400 (often at the time of service). What makes \\nthis service \\'covered\\' is that the cost counts toward the annual \\ndeductible, so only $600 would remain to be paid by the \\npatient for future services before the insurance company \\nstarts to pay its share.  \\n 4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 1/32As a library , NLM provides access to scientific literature.

Prepared for a 15-nation comparative study for the Organization for Economic\\nCooperation and Development (OECD), the article summarizes descriptive data on the \\x00inanc-\\ning, utilization, access, and supply of U.S. health services; analyzes health system cost growth\\nand trends; reviews health reforms adopted in the 1980s; and discusses proposals in the cur-\\nrent health system reform debate.\\nIntroduction\\nThis article was prepared for a 15-country comparative analysis of health system reforms in\\nthe 1980s in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. This\\nOECD project follows up on an earlier 7—country comparative study (Schneider, 1991). This\\narticle pulls together basic structural information, reviews trends in the growth of health sys-\\ntem costs and indicators, discusses the major health system reforms of the 1980s, and summa-\\nrizes the proposed changes currently being debated. As a part of this OECD project, a compara-\\ntive study of all 15 countries is currently being written and will be published by OECD, along\\nwith the individual country papers early next year.\\nOverview\\nFinancing\\nThe United States spends more on health care services than does any other nation—on aver-\\nage, more than twice as much per person as the other OECD countries (Schieber, Poullier, and\\nGreenwald, 1991). These expenditures are \\x00inanced by a complex mixture of public payers1\\n4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 2/32(Federal, State, and local government), as well as private insurance and individual payments:\\nThere is no single nationwide system of health insurance. The United States primarily relies on\\nemployers to voluntarily provide health insurance coverage to their employees and depen-\\ndents; government programs are con\\x00ined to the elderly, the disabled, and some of the poor.\\nThese private and public health insurance programs all differ with respect to bene\\x00its covered,\\nsources of \\x00inancing, and payments to medical care providers. There is little coordination be-\\ntween private and public programs: Some people have both public and private insurance while\\nothers have neither. Nevertheless, persons without health insurance are not entirely without\\nhealth care. Although they receive fewer and less coordinated services than those with insur-\\nance, many of these “uninsured” individuals receive health care services through public clinics\\nand hospitals, State and local health programs, or private providers who \\x00inance the care\\nthrough charity and by shifting costs to other payers.\\nOrganization\\nHealth services are provided by a loosely structured delivery system organized at the local\\nlevel. Hospitals can open or close according to community resources, preferences, and the dic-\\ntates of an open market for hospital services. Also, physicians are free to establish their prac-\\ntice where they choose. There is no health planning at the Federal level, and State planning ef-\\nforts vary from none to stringent review of hospital and nursing home construction projects.\\nIn areas without suf\\x00icient private providers (e.g., inner cities and remote rural areas), Federal-\\nand State-funded programs provide some primary care to populations not otherwise served by\\nthe fee-for-service (FFS) system. Municipal and county public health departments provide lim-\\nited primary care services through public health clinics and regulate sanitation, water supply,\\nand environmental hazards.\\nMost hospitals are owned by private non-pro\\x00it institutions; the remainder are owned by gov-\\nernments or private for-pro\\x00it corporations. Physicians, the vast majority of whom are in pri-\\nvate practice and paid on an FFS basis, see their patients in their of\\x00ices, and admit them to\\nhospitals where they can continue to serve them. About two-\\x00ifths of physicians are in solo\\npractice. Although there is a long-term trend toward the formation of more and larger group\\npractices, the proportion of solo practices is shrinking only at a very slow rate (Marder et al.,\\n1988). A relatively small number of physicians is not in the FFS sector but is employed by the\\ngovernment, corporations, managed care networks, or hospitals.\\nHealth reform in the 1980s and 1990s\\nIn recent years, health reform in the United States has focused on controlling rapidly rising\\nhealth costs and increasing \\x00inancial access to health care. A variety of cost-control strategies\\nhave been attempted at the Federal, State, and local levels of government and by private pay-\\ners. Despite these efforts, health care costs continue to escalate. The resulting pressure on pub-\\nlic, private, and individual budgets keeps the issue of control of health care costs high on the\\npublic agenda.\\nBackground\\nSources of health insurance4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 3/32Private The vast majority of the population, about 74 percent, is covered by private health in-\\nsurance (Figure 1). Those under 65 years of age and their dependents obtain private health in-\\nsurance either through their employers (61 percent of the population) or by direct purchase of\\nnon-group health insurance (13 percent of the population). A small proportion of the popula-\\ntion, 13 percent, has multiple health insurance coverage (e.g., both private and public health\\ninsurance), and 14 percent have no insurance (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1991b). Not all \\x00irms\\noffer health insurance. In fact the majority of the uninsured (75 percent) are employees or\\ntheir dependents (Short, Monheit, and Beauregard, 1989).\\nFigure 1\\nU . S . \\t h e a l t h \\t i n s u r a n c e \\t c o v e r a g e : \\t 1 9 9 0\\nThere are more than 1,000 private health insurance companies providing health insurance\\npolicies with different bene\\x00it structures, premiums, and rules for paying the insured or medi-\\ncal care providers. These companies are regulated by State insurance commissioners; the\\nFederal Government does not generally regulate insurance companies. States sometimes spec-\\nify that certain, often narrowly de\\x00ined, bene\\x00its or providers (e.g., chiropractic services) be\\ncovered by all health insurance policies sold in the State. States may also regulate insurance\\npremium increases and other aspects of the insurance industry. In recent years, most large em-\\nployers have opted to “self-insure,” or cover health expenses as they occur, rather than pur-\\nchase insurance from a company, because this exempts them from State insurance regulation\\nas detailed later.\\nAlthough employer-provided health insurance is voluntary, it is encouraged by tax policy.\\nEmployer-paid contributions to employee health costs are basically a substitute for cash wages.\\nThis substitution has increased in recent years. Health bene\\x00its rose from 2.4 percent of total\\ncompensation in 1970 to 5.8 percent in 1989, and from 23 percent of total bene\\x00its in 1970 to\\n36 percent in 1989 (Employee Bene\\x00it Research Institute, 1991). When employers pay wages in\\nthe form of health bene\\x00its, they are subject neither to the personal income tax nor to the\\nSocial Security tax. If such wages were taxed as income, then Federal revenues would have in-\\ncreased by an estimated $56 billion in 1990 (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1990).\\nIndividuals with relatively high medical expenses, more than 7.5 percent of their taxable in-24/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 4/32come, may be able to deduct out-of-pocket health care expenditures from their Federal income\\ntaxes, for a 1990 cost of about $2.9 billion (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1990). Employer\\ncontributions to group health insurance were estimated to be $139 billion in 1990 (Levit and\\nCowan, 1991).\\nThe majority of those with private health insurance are covered for inpatient hospital services\\nand physician services; the breadth and depth of coverage of other services vary. Industries\\nwith strong unions (e.g., steel, automobile) have the broadest bene\\x00it packages. On the other\\nhand, service industries (e.g., restaurants) may provide little or no coverage (Friedman, 1991).\\nThe amount of patient cost sharing also varies. For example, as many as 55 million Americans\\nwith private health insurance are underinsured, that is, they do not have a limit on their out-of-\\npocket health expenses and are at risk of being impoverished should they experience a costly,\\nmajor illness (Farley, 1985). Home care is covered in most insurance plans after a hospitaliza-\\ntion for an acute episode of illness in order to allow recovery in a less costly setting. Home care\\nand long-term care for chronic conditions and frailty related to aging are not generally covered\\nby public or private insurance. Most long-term care and home care are purchased out-of-\\npocket or provided informally by family and friends. In the last few years, some private health\\ninsurers have been marketing long-term care policies, primarily to upper income individuals\\nwho can afford the premiums. However, Medicaid (described later) does pay for long-term care\\nand home care services for the poor, and \\x00inances nearly one-half of the annual nursing home\\nexpenditure of $53.1 billion (Levit et al., 1991b).\\nMedicare Medicare is a uniform national health insurance program for the aged and disabled.\\nAdministered by the Federal Government, it is the single largest health insurer in the country,\\ncovering about 13 percent of the population, including virtually all the elderly 65 years of age\\nor over (31 million people), and certain persons with disabilities or kidney failure (3 million\\npeople) (Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, 1992). The program\\nis \\x00inanced by a combination of payroll taxes, general Federal revenues, and premiums. It is\\ncomprised of two parts: Coverage under Part A is earned through payment of a payroll tax\\nduring one\\'s working years; coverage under Part B is voluntarily obtained through payment of\\na premium once eligibility for Medicare is established (through receipt of retirement or disabil-\\nity bene\\x00its under the Social Security income assistance program).\\nMedicare is an inter-generational transfer program primarily funded by taxes from working\\npeople to provide services to aged bene\\x00iciaries. However, this \\x00inancing approach is not actu-\\narially sound: Expenses are increasing faster than revenues, leading to a projected trust fund\\nbankruptcy early in the next century (Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance\\nTrust Fund, 1992). As the population ages, there will be fewer workers supporting each bene\\x00i-\\nciary. There were 5 workers for each bene\\x00iciary in 1960, there will be 3 workers per bene\\x00i-\\nciary in 2000, and 1.9 by the year 2040 (U.S. House of Representatives, 1991).\\nCoverage under Part A includes inpatient hospital care, very limited nursing home services,\\nand some home health services. The Part A payroll tax is paid by virtually all employed individ-\\nuals. The payroll tax is 1.45 percent of payroll for both the employer and the employee (for a\\ntotal of 2.9 percent) up to a maximum of $125,000 of income. This maximum was raised in\\n1990 from $51,300. Employer contributions to Medicare Part A were nearly $30 billion in 1990\\n(Levit and Cowan, 1991). Coverage under Part B includes physician and other ambulatory ser-4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 5/32vices, durable medical equipment (e.g., wheelchairs), and certain other services. It is funded\\nthrough premiums (about 25 percent of the program cost), by enrollees ($31.80 per month in\\n1992), and by general Federal revenues (about 75 percent of the program cost).\\nMedicare is oriented towards acute care, and such services as long-term nursing home care,\\nroutine eye care, and outpatient prescription drugs are not covered. Moreover, Medicare pa-\\ntients must also pay coinsurance and deductibles: These account for an average of 17 percent\\nof the services covered by Medicare, and consume an average of 6 percent of their per capita\\nincome (U.S. House of Representatives, 1991). Medicare covers less than one-half of the total\\nmedical care expenses of the elderly (Waldo et al., 1989). To pay for Medicare coinsurance and\\ndeductibles and, in some cases, uncovered bene\\x00its, about 68 percent of Medicare bene\\x00iciaries\\nhave private supplemental health plans, provided by former employers or self-purchased, and\\nan additional 9 percent have Medicaid (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1991a). Despite all of these\\nsources of health insurance, the elderly spend an increasing share of their after-tax income on\\nhealth expenses, up from 7.8 percent in 1972 to 12.5 percent in 1988 (U.S. House of\\nRepresentatives, 1991).\\nMedicaid Medicaid is a health insurance program for certain groups of the poor. It covers pre-\\nventive, acute, and long-term care services for 25 million people, or 10 percent of the popula-\\ntion. Medicaid is jointly \\x00inanced by Federal and State governments. The Federal Government\\nmatches State Medicaid outlays at rates which vary by State personal-income levels: The\\nFederal share of total expenditures ranges from 50 to 83 percent, with the poorer States re-\\nceiving a higher match from the Federal Government. Medicaid is administered by the States\\nunder broad Federal guidelines governing the scope of services, the level of payments to\\nproviders, and population groups eligible for coverage.\\nIn order to be eligible for Medicaid, a person must be poor as well as aged, blind, disabled,\\npregnant, or the parent of a dependent child. Mothers and dependent children comprise about\\n68 percent of Medicaid recipients, the elderly 13 percent, the blind and disabled 15 percent,\\nand others 4 percent. States further de\\x00ine eligibility levels (e.g., maximum income and asset\\nlevels) within certain broad parameters. Consequently, about 60 percent of the poor below the\\nFederal poverty line are excluded from Medicaid (Swartz and Lipson, 1989). Childless, non-dis-\\nabled adults under 65 years of age, no matter how poor or how high their medical expenses,\\nare not eligible, nor are individuals with assets above State-de\\x00ined levels. On the other hand,\\nbecause Medicaid is the only public program that \\x00inances long-term nursing home care, a sig-\\nni\\x00icant number of middle-class elderly have become eligible for Medicaid-covered nursing\\nhome care by intentionally transferring assets to their children and exhausting their income on\\nnursing home expenses (Burwell, 1991). About 43 percent of Medicaid expenditures are spent\\non skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities (Ruther et al., 1991).\\nOther The uninsured receive fewer health services than insured individuals with comparable\\nhealth status (Freeman et al., 1987). Services for the uninsured are provided through a variety\\nof sources, the amount and scope of which vary by community. Federal, State, and local govern-\\nments support public health clinics and hospitals with a primary mission of providing care to\\nthe indigent. In some cases they pay private providers to care for the indigent as well. Public\\nhealth expenditures support preventive health measures such as vaccinations, cancer screen-\\ning programs, and well-child care. The services are often available to all, although a fee which\\nvaries according to income may be charged.4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 6/32Providers sometimes subsidize the costs of services to uninsured individuals from operating\\nmargins. Charity care and bad debt represented 5 percent of hospital expenses in 1988\\n(Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, 1991). Estimates of physician charity care are\\ndif\\x00icult to make because, unlike hospitals, physicians do not submit detailed cost reports to the\\nFederal Government. A recent study estimated that physicians provide $3 billion worth of free\\nservices and nearly $4 billion of reduced-fee services annually (American Medical Association,\\n1991). However, as insurers and employers try to control their own costs, the ability of hospi-\\ntals and other providers to cross-subsidize care for the uninsured, by cost-shifting to insurers\\nand employers, may decrease.\\nHealth spending\\nNational income and health In 1990, about 12.2 percent of GNP was devoted to health expendi-\\ntures. This amounted to $666.2 billion ($2,566 per capita), an increase of 10.3 percent over\\n1989 levels (Levit et al., 1991a). The United States spent a higher percentage of its wealth on\\nhealth than any other OECD country (Schieber, Poullier, and Greenwald, 1991). Health expendi-\\ntures have been growing rapidly both as a share of GNP and in absolute terms. For example,\\nhealth expenditures in 1980 accounted for 9.1 percent of GNP and are projected to rise to\\nmore than 16 percent of GNP by the year 2000 (Sonnefeld et al., 1991). One reason for this\\nrapid growth is the sluggish U.S. economy and slow GNP growth. However, in\\x00lation in medical\\nprices has long been signi\\x00icantly higher than general in\\x00lation (Levit et al., 1991b).\\nSource of funds Public budgets accounted for 42 percent of health spending in 1990, and pri-\\nvate sector spending accounted for 58 percent (Figure 2) (Levit et al., 1991a). The proportion\\nof total health care expenditures covered by public sources is lower in the United States than in\\nall but one of the OECD member countries (Schieber, Poullier, and Greenwald, 1991). The\\nFederal budget paid for 29 percent of all health spending, primarily through the Medicare and\\nMedicaid programs, but also through health spending by the Departments of Defense and\\nVeterans Affairs for current and retired military personnel and their dependents. Of the 13\\npercent State and local share of health spending, approximately 5 percent was for Medicaid,\\nand 8 percent was for other State and local health programs (Levit et al., 1991a).4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 7/32\\nFigure 2\\nT h e \\t N a t i o n \\' s \\t h e a l t h \\t d o l l a r : \\t 1 9 9 0\\nHealth expenditures comprise a growing share of public budgets. In 1990, health represented\\n15 percent of the Federal budget and 11 percent of State and local budgets. By contrast, health\\nexpenditures in 1980 comprised 12 percent of the Federal budget and 9 percent of State bud-\\ngets. Medicare alone is now 9 percent of the Federal budget (Levit et al., 1991a). Of the 58 per-\\ncent of all health spending that was not \\x00inanced by public budgets, 33 percent was paid for by\\nprivate insurance payments, 20 percent by individuals out-of-pocket, and 5 percent by other\\nprivate payments, including philanthropy (Levit et al., 1991a). In 1990, approximately 39 per-\\ncent of total health spending was for hospital care, 19 percent for physician services, 8 percent\\nfor nursing home care, 22 percent for other personal health care spending, and 12 percent for\\nother non-personal health care items such as research and construction (Levit et al., 1991a).\\nTrends in spending The annual growth rate of health spending in the 1980s was about 10.4\\npercent as a whole, but varied by type of service. Hospital spending grew by about 15 percent\\nper year in the early 1980s, slowed to about 7 percent in the mid-1980s, and increased to4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 8/32about 10 percent by the end of the decade. Physician spending growth through the decade av-\\neraged about 15 percent per year, but moderated somewhat toward the end of the decade\\n(Levit et al., 1991a).\\nThe share of all health spending accounted for by private health insurance and government\\nprograms rose slightly over the 1980s, while out-of-pocket spending marginally declined (Levit\\net al., 1991a). The increased use of cost sharing as a cost-containment measure, described later,\\nhas not kept pace with rapidly rising health care costs.\\nInsurance coverage by service Insurance coverage varies by service. Hospital care is the best\\ninsured, and nursing home care and dental care are the least well insured. Out-of-pocket pay-\\nments for hospital care cover only 6 percent of total hospital spending, public programs\\n(Medicare and Medicaid) 40 percent, other State and local programs 14 percent, private insur-\\nance 36 percent, and private charity care the remaining 4 percent. On the other hand, out-of-\\npocket payments for nursing home expenditures \\x00inance 44 percent of total nursing home\\nspending, Medicaid covers 43 percent, Medicare and other non-Medicaid State and local funds\\ncover 7 percent, private charity covers 2 percent, and private insurance covers only 1 percent\\n(Levit et al., 1991a). Most employer-sponsored group health plans cover outpatient prescrip-\\ntion drugs as does Medicaid, while Medicare does not.\\nPatient cost sharing As employers and insurers try to contain costs, patient cost sharing is be-\\ncoming a more common feature of almost all U.S. health plans (Employee Bene\\x00it Research\\nInstitute, 1991). Typical deductibles are $100 to $500 per person per year, and typical coinsur-\\nance rates are 20 percent per service (Employee Bene\\x00it Research Institute, 1990). The RAND\\nCorporation national health insurance experiment found that the use of cost sharing as a cost-\\ncontainment tool reduced utilization without adversely affecting health status, except for low-\\nincome individuals with hypertension, vision, or dental problems (Newhouse et al., 1981). The\\nimpact on the health status of the low-income and the exclusion of the elderly and chronically\\nill from the experiment suggest some caution about the general use of cost sharing as a cost-\\ncontainment tool. The proportion of private health plans with limits on out-of-pocket spending\\nincreased steadily during the last decade. Nevertheless, as previously noted, many policies still\\ndo not offer full protection against catastrophic expenses (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1989,\\n1982).\\nHealth services delivery system\\nHospitals There are about 6,700 hospitals in the United States, including 5,480 community,\\nacute care hospitals, 880 specialty hospitals (e.g., psychiatric, rehabilitation, long-term care),\\nand 340 Federal hospitals open only to military personnel, veterans, or native Americans. Of\\nthe 5,480 community hospitals, non-pro\\x00it hospitals represent 59 percent, local government\\nhospitals 27 percent, and for-pro\\x00it hospitals 14 percent. There are 3.9 community hospital\\nbeds for each 1,000 residents, although this varies around the country. There were 33 million\\nhospital admissions in 1990 with an average length of stay per admission of 9.2 days. Hospital\\nstays are shorter and admission rates are lower in the United States compared with other\\nOECD countries. The average hospital occupancy rate, 66 percent, is lower in the United States\\nthan in other OECD countries, however this rate varies and may be 40 percent or lower in ru-\\nral areas (American Hospital Association, 1990; National Center for Health Statistics, 1991).4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 9/32Hospitals \\x00inance capital purchases through a variety of means including savings, tax-exempt\\nbond issues, and philanthropy. Although Federal and State mortgage loan guarantee programs\\nassist some hospitals to secure \\x00inancing for construction and renovation projects, it is more\\ncommon for hospitals to secure private mortgage insurance when \\x00loating a construction bond.\\nSome States require prior approval before certain capital projects can be undertaken, while\\nother States have no prior approval procedures.\\nBecause physicians in the community admit their patients to hospitals, hospitals must be attrac-\\ntive to physicians in order to obtain patients. This makes it dif\\x00icult for hospitals to deny physi-\\ncian requests to purchase expensive equipment, because purchasing such equipment is a way\\nthat hospitals attempt to attract physicians. As a result, hospitals engage in what has been\\ncalled a medical arms race, in which each competes to own state-of-the-art technology. The\\nUnited States has 8 times more magnetic resonance imaging machines (MRIs) per capita, 6\\ntimes more lithotripsy centers, and 3 times more cardiac catheterization and open heart sur-\\ngery units than Canada (Rublee, 1989).\\nPhysicians\\nThere were more than 574,000 physicians in active practice in 1988, or 2.3 active physicians\\nper 1,000 population (National Center for Health Statistics, 1991). In the early 1980s, a na-\\ntional physician surplus was forecasted for the 1990s (U.S. Department of Health and Human\\nServices, 1981). Now this forecast is being debated. A physician surplus causes concern be-\\ncause some argue that physicians can create demand and thereby add to rising health costs\\n(Rice and LaBelle, 1989).\\nNonetheless, problems exist in the geographic and specialty distribution of physicians. For in-\\nstance, the physician-to-population ratio averages 0.9 active physicians per 1,000 population in\\nrural areas (U.S. Of\\x00ice of Technology Assessment, 1990). Of those in active practice, about 33\\npercent are primary care physicians (family practice, general pediatrics, and internal medicine)\\nand the remainder are specialists (Politzer et al., 1989). There is concern that the proportion of\\nprimary care physicians will continue to fall in the coming decade. The United States has a\\nmuch higher percentage of specialists than do other OECD countries (Rosenblatt, 1992).\\nIndividuals can access specialists directly except in some coordinated care settings (described\\nlater). Some specialists (e.g., radiologists, anesthesiologists, and pathologists) practice in hospi-\\ntals under contract. Compensation arrangements with hospital-based physicians vary but often\\ninclude a salary as well as FFS billings of which the physician retains a percentage.\\nIn the past, most high-technology equipment was purchased by hospitals. Recently, however,\\nphysicians, either alone or in joint ventures, have been purchasing high-technology equipment\\noutside the traditional con\\x00ines of the hospital. Joint ventures are arrangements where in-\\nvestors pool capital to purchase expensive equipment and build facilities such as ambulatory\\nsurgery centers. Some argue that these practices rapidly diffuse high technologies, create com-\\npetition with hospitals for ambulatory procedures, increase utilization, and fuel health in\\x00lation\\n(Florida Health Care Cost Containment Board, 1991).4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 10/32Medical education is \\x00inanced by a combination of student tuition payments, Federal and State\\neducation programs, and private funds. Public funds support medical education through State-\\nsupported medical schools (about 60 percent of all medical schools), Federal and State student\\nloan programs, Federal health education programs, and Medicare payments for graduate medi-\\ncal education in teaching hospitals. In 1990, about 80 percent of medical students had an aver-\\nage debt of $46,224 upon graduation from medical school (Jolin et al., 1991). High-paid special-\\nties are more attractive to medical students than the lower paid family and general practice for\\na variety of reasons (Colwill, 1992). Reform of medical education \\x00inancing, in order to in\\x00lu-\\nence new physicians\\' choice of specialty and geographic location, is an important public policy\\ngoal. Proposals include reducing Medicare payments to new physicians who locate in over-\\nserved areas, and increasing funds for the current Federal program (the National Health\\nService Corps) which forgives student debt in return for practicing in underserved areas.\\nCoordinated care In recent years, coordinated care arrangements have become increasingly\\npopular as a way to control costs in both the private and public sectors. The term coordinated\\ncare refers to a diverse and rapidly changing set of alternative health care delivery models.\\nThese models differ from traditional FFS medicine by integrating the \\x00inancing and delivery of\\nhealth services with the goal of controlling costs by managing utilization and provider payment\\nlevels.\\nThe oldest model of coordinated care is the health maintenance organization (HMO); several\\nhave existed for decades, although most have been formed in recent years. Individuals who en-\\nroll in an HMO receive a comprehensive bene\\x00it package available only from a de\\x00ined network\\nof providers for a \\x00ixed payment, usually a monthly or yearly premium. To compensate for the\\nrestricted choice of providers, enrollees often face lower cost sharing and have little billing pa-\\nperwork compared with FFS medicine. HMOs themselves range from long-established organi-\\nzations that employ physicians, build their own hospitals and clinics, and only serve HMO en-\\nrollees, to recent af\\x00iliations of solo practice physicians and hospitals who may also practice\\ntraditional FFS medicine. Nearly 37 million Americans, 15 percent of the population, are en-\\nrolled in HMOs (Porter, Ball, and Kraus, 1992).\\nA more recent model is the preferred provider organization (PPO) which selectively contracts\\nwith or arranges for a network of doctors, hospitals, and others to provide services at a dis-\\ncounted price schedule. Individuals pay lower coinsurance rates if they visit physicians who\\nhave agreed to accept a lower price. Similar to HMOs, the PPO model includes utilization review,\\nand formal standards are used to select and maintain network providers and physicians. PPO\\nenrollment grew from only 1 percent of participants in medium and large employer health\\nplans in 1986 to 10 percent in 1989 (U.S. Department of Labor, 1990).\\nA recent development is the point-of-service (POS) network. POS networks start with an HMO\\nand add a PPO component in an attempt to achieve both cost containment and freedom of\\nchoice of providers. Enrollees are encouraged to use HMO doctors by paying a higher coinsur-\\nance charge if they use doctors not af\\x00iliated with the HMO. By contrast, in a PPO, the doctor\\nsimply accepts a lower price for certain patients with no equivalent HMO structure with its em-\\nphasis on coordinated care. It is expected that the features of POS networks will continue to\\nevolve.4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 11/32Studies suggest that HMOs can save about 20-30 percent compared with FFS insurance, pri-\\nmarily by reducing inpatient hospital days (Manning et al., 1984). However, in some instances\\nthese savings are the result of favorable selection of enrollees rather than more cost effective\\nuse of health services. The cost advantages of HMOs compared with FFS medicine may be re-\\nduced as utilization controls are increasingly introduced into the FFS sector. Quality assurance\\nat HMOs is an important issue. There is concern that HMOs, and especially for-pro\\x00it HMOs,\\nhave economic incentives to underserve their enrollees in order to live within the capitated\\npayment. On the other hand, HMOs may need to offer care of at least reasonable quality in or-\\nder to be attractive to enrollees.\\nCoordinated care, as used broadly, includes not only HMOs and PPOs but also a variety of other\\ncost-control techniques, in\\x00luencing patient care decisions before services are provided. These\\ntechniques, increasingly imposed by third-party payers, include prior approval of hospital ad-\\nmissions, management of high-cost patient care, control of referrals to specialists through pri-\\nmary care physicians, selective contracting with hospitals and other providers, required second\\nopinions for surgical procedures, pro\\x00ile analysis of provider utilization and practice patterns,\\nand screening of claims prior to payment to avoid duplicate and inappropriate payments.\\nAlthough the evidence on utilization review is not complete, some of these techniques, such as\\npreadmission certi\\x00ication and review during an inpatient hospital stay, are cost effective\\n(Schef\\x00ler, Sullivan, and Ko, 1991).\\nHealth outcomes\\nDespite the highest health expenditures in the world, the United States does not perform par-\\nticularly well in terms of gross health outcome measures. For instance, in 1988 the United\\nStates had a life expectancy at birth of 71.5 years for males and 78.3 years for females, and an\\ninfant mortality rate of 10.0 per 100,000 births. Compared with the other OECD countries, it\\nranked 17th in male life expectancy, 16th in female life expectancy, and 20th in infant mortality\\n(Schieber, Poullier, and Greenwald, 1991).\\nHowever, direct comparisons of U.S. health costs and outcomes with OECD nations can be mis-\\nleading because of exacerbated social problems in the United States which have signi\\x00icant\\nhealth costs and adversely affect U.S. health outcomes. The 20,000 annual U.S. homicides result\\nin per capita homicide rates 10 times those of Great Britain and 4 times those of Canada. There\\nare 100 assaults reported by U.S. emergency rooms for every homicide. About 25 percent of\\nspinal cord injuries result from assaults; lifetime care for a quadriplegic averages $600,000.\\nThe United States has about 375,000 drug-exposed babies, and estimated 5-year costs of treat-\\nment are $63,000 per child. U.S. child poverty rates are double those of former West Germany\\nand Canada, and triple those of Switzerland and Sweden (Schwartz, 1991; Rich, 1991;\\nSmeeding et al., 1988).\\nThe United States has had a total of 206,000 acquired immunode\\x00iciency syndrome (AIDS)\\ncases, and there were 39,000 AIDS deaths in 1990 alone. The U.S. AIDS infection rate is more\\nthan four times that of Canada (Pan American Health Organization, 1992). The average lifetime\\nhealth costs of an AIDS patient are now $85,000. These costs may increase as new drugs are\\ndeveloped to prolong the life of AIDS patients. AIDS is putting budget pressures on inner-city4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 12/32hospitals and emergency rooms because many AIDS patients do not have adequate insurance.\\nRecent studies estimate that the United States will spend $5.8 billion caring for AIDS patients in\\n1991, and that these costs will rise rapidly to $10.4 billion by 1994 (Hellinger, 1991).\\nHealth outcomes for some minority groups are signi\\x00icantly worse than the U.S. average. The\\ninfant mortality rate for Native Americans is 1.5 times the rate for white people and the rate for\\nblack people is 2.1 times the rate for white people (National Center for Health Statistics, 1991).\\nLife expectancy has been signi\\x00icantly higher for white people than for black people for the last\\n20 years. Homicide is the leading cause of death for black people between 15 and 44 years of\\nage, with the rate for black males more than 8 times the rate for white males of the same age\\n(National Center for Health Statistics, 1991).\\nData and evaluation systems\\nWhen evaluating health services, the United States is both data rich and poor. Compared with\\nhealth systems where there is a single payer, U.S. data are divided among many insurers, mak-\\ning it virtually impossible to produce comprehensive provider or bene\\x00iciary pro\\x00iles. However,\\nthe United States also requires detailed diagnostic and procedural information on each bill paid\\nin an FFS system. Moreover, hospital admissions and major surgery often require preadmis-\\nsion review. Consequently, a great deal of information that is unavailable in systems which do\\nnot require detailed bills is produced at the patient level.\\nVarious systems to improve data and to coordinate data systems are under development. The\\nInstitute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences has issued several reports calling for\\nmore health outcomes research and improved data systems, including computerized patient\\nrecords (Institute of Medicine, 1991). The Federal Government publishes uniform mortality\\nstatistics for hospitals based on Medicare billing records and quality information on nursing\\nhomes based on periodic inspections. The Medicare program is also developing a uniform clini-\\ncal data set to evaluate the quality of care and outcomes of Medicare patients. The Federal re-\\nsearch effort on medical outcomes, including the development of medical practice guidelines, is\\ncoordinated by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.\\nData are also used by commercial \\x00irms in order to evaluate providers for inclusion in man-\\naged care networks. Such \\x00irms analyze companies\\' claims experience, health utilization, and\\noutcomes. These data help to identify ef\\x00icient providers with whom the purchasers should\\ncontract, and inef\\x00icient providers who should be excluded. Other \\x00irms analyze drug prescrip-\\ntion data to identify over-prescribers, as well as potential adverse drug interactions which may\\nproduce avoidable hospitalizations.\\nBackground for reform in the 1980s\\nEnactment of Medicare and Medicaid\\nThe \\x00irst nationwide hospital insurance bill was introduced in Congress in 1942, but failed to\\npass. Discussions of various forms of national health insurance over the next two decades cul-\\nminated in the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Medicare and Medicaid were a\\ncompromise between those who wanted national health insurance for everyone, and those4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 13/32who wanted the private sector to continue to be the source of insurance coverage. The elderly\\nand the poor were at high risk for health expenses beyond their means and were less likely\\nthan other population groups to have health insurance. The elderly were generally considered\\nto be uninsurable or bad risks by the private insurance market. In 1963, 75 percent of adults\\nunder age 65 had hospital insurance compared with 56 percent of people 65 years of age or\\nover. In 1966, following passage of Medicare, about 19 million elderly people, or 10 percent of\\nthe population, received health insurance coverage. This nearly doubled the number of insured\\n65 years of age or over. Medicare coverage was extended to the under age 65 population with\\ndisabilities or end stage renal disease, about 2 million new enrollees, in 1972 (Cohen, 1986;\\nGornick et al., 1986; Mills, 1986).\\nMedicaid initially covered about 10 million people, adding an unknown number of recipients to\\nthose covered under other State and local welfare programs. By 1973, there were 19.6 million\\nMedicaid enrollees. Most Medicaid enrollees are children and mothers under the income as-\\nsistance program called Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) (Cohen, 1986;\\nGornick et al., 1986; Mills, 1986).\\nThis large expansion of third-party coverage combined with generous payment methods (both\\nMedicare and Medicaid originally paid hospitals their costs and Medicare largely paid physi-\\ncians their charges) was one of the principal engines of health care cost growth in the 1970s\\nand 1980s. In addition, the passage of Medicare and Medicaid gave the Federal Government an\\ninstitutional interest in health care cost containment as it suddenly became the single largest\\nhealth insurer.\\nHealth care in the 1970s\\nThe 1970s were characterized by rapid expansions in health care costs, and the development\\nof strategies for their containment. Cost-control strategies emphasized regulation and planning.\\nThe National Health Planning Act of 1974 created a system of State and local health planning\\nagencies largely supported by Federal funds. States passed certi\\x00icate-of-need laws designed to\\nlimit investment in expensive hospital and nursing home facilities. The Carter Administration\\n(1977-81) advocated direct Federal controls on hospital spending, however, Congress failed to\\nenact them. With the installation of the Reagan Administration in 1980, a pro-competitive ap-\\nproach to cost containment was advanced and the health planning legislation was repealed in\\n1986 by Public Law 99-660.\\nSigni\\x00icant expansion of government support for medical education was designed to address a\\nperceived shortage of physicians. Medical school enrollment doubled over the course of the\\ndecade. Government funds also supported a growing biomedical research and development\\ncommunity, with its hub at the National Institutes of Health.\\nAlthough not generally recognized at the time as a bill affecting health care, the 1974 Employee\\nRetirement Income and Security Act (ERISA) has had a profound impact on health policy (Fox\\net al., 1989). The legislation was passed to regulate corporate use of pension funds, but it also\\npre-empted State regulation of self-insuring employee bene\\x00it plans generally. Growing num-\\nbers of larger employers were already moving to self-insured health bene\\x00its as a cost-control\\nmechanism prior to ERISA\\'s passage. The ERISA pre-emption provided further incentives to4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 14/32employers to convert their employee health bene\\x00it plans to self-insurance. Employers now\\nhave a large stake in the ERISA Federal pre-emption because many have structured their health\\nbene\\x00it plans to take advantage of its provisions and exemptions.\\nU.S. health system in the 1980s\\nAs frequently noted, the U.S. health care system suffers from rapid escalation of health costs,\\nlack of universal access to insurance coverage, geographic maldistribution of providers, under-\\nutilization of primary care and preventive services, gaps in the continuity of care, and a high\\nrate of inappropriate utilization of health services. These problems coexist with widely ac-\\nknowledged strengths such as providing the vast majority of the population with state-of-the-\\nart care, offering consumers freedom of choice among a variety of highly skilled providers us-\\ning the latest technology, and promoting a vigorous biomedical research and development sec-\\ntor. There are sophisticated quality assurance and data systems, and virtually no queues for\\nelective surgery for those with insurance.\\nHealth care cost growth Growth in U.S. health care costs results in part from such unique fea-\\ntures as the predominant FFS payment system, extensive third-party insurance coverage, a\\nfragmented multipayer system, and a vigorous biomedical research establishment combined\\nwith rapid diffusion of new technologies. The fragmented U.S. structure gives providers incen-\\ntives to provide additional services and to bill for higher levels of service to increase revenues.\\nAlthough coordinated care arrangements encourage provision of services within \\x00ixed budgets,\\nthey have only recently become more widespread. Moreover, coordinated care itself may have\\ndif\\x00iculty in controlling utilization in a system whose basic structure continues to reward in-\\ncreased FFS billings. In contrast to the United States, other OECD countries control health costs\\nthrough central control of budgets and all-payer ratesetting.\\nHealth care costs are perceived as reducing the international competitiveness of American\\nbusiness, however, there is debate on this issue. For example, Chrysler states that health care\\ncosts add $700 to the price of every American manufactured car. By comparison, health care\\ncosts add $350 to the cost of a car in Germany and France, or $225 in Japan (Graig, 1991).\\n(This, of course, re\\x00lects health bene\\x00its provided in lieu of past and present wages to retirees\\nand current workers, and the aging labor force of the industrial sector.) Others argue that the\\nissue is the total labor compensation package, not fringe bene\\x00its alone (Reinhardt, 1989).\\nBecause health insurance in the United States is primarily employer-based, cost containment\\nmust be a high priority for employers if cost-control goals are to be attained. However, employ-\\ners provide health bene\\x00its as a means of attracting a trained and stable labor force. Employers\\nmay become ambivalent about aggressive cost-containment strategies if the result is potential\\nlabor unrest (there have been several recent strikes over employer health bene\\x00it reductions).\\nMoreover, the business community has been split between industries that provide comprehen-\\nsive bene\\x00its to older, unionized workers, and newer service industries that provide much\\nmore limited fringe bene\\x00its of all types to younger and healthier workers. The former, such as\\nthe automobile industry, is increasingly concerned about high health costs resulting from an\\naging labor force, and the shifting of costs to them for the health care provided to uninsured\\nworkers in the service sectors. This creates a new political situation in which the business com-\\nmunity is no longer united against fundamental reform of the health care system.34/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 15/32Administrative costs U.S. administrative costs are high and a source of unnecessary expendi-\\ntures. Efforts are under way to standardize electronic billing across all payers in order to re-\\nduce administrative costs (Sullivan, 1992). Despite consensus that administrative ef\\x00iciencies\\nare possible, there is disagreement about the extent to which adopting a single payer system or\\nalternative health insurance arrangements would reduce administrative or total systems costs.\\nAdvocates of national health insurance argue that Canada has been able to provide universal\\nhealth insurance coverage while spending substantially less than the United States. In particu-\\nlar, they compare administrative costs in the United States and Canada, and suggest that the dif-\\nference in these alone (an estimated $60 to $70 billion, or about 10 percent of total 1991 U.S.\\nhealth costs) could \\x00inance health coverage for the uninsured (Woolhandler and Himmelstein,\\n1991; U.S. General Accounting Of\\x00ice, 1991; Newhouse, Anderson, and Roos, 1988). Others ar-\\ngue that these comparisons are unsound. They fail to properly value the positive effect of those\\nadministrative costs designed to coordinate care, assure quality, and control utilization, misap-\\nprehend that cost differences result from factors other than the single payer mechanism, and\\nignore or do not capture other costs of the Canadian system, for example, increased patient\\nwaiting time (Danzon, 1991).\\nMedical malpractice Another alleged source of excessive health spending is the high cost of\\nmedical malpractice premiums and defensive medicine. (The fear of a malpractice suit is said to\\ninduce doctors to order unnecessary tests and services. However, this behavior also maximizes\\nFFS physicians\\' practice income.) Professional liability costs for physician services are esti-\\nmated to be about $20 billion, only $5 billion of which are malpractice premiums, or less than 1\\npercent of all health spending. The remainder, or $15 billion (another 3 percent of health\\nspending), is the estimated cost of defensive medicine (American Medical Association, 1990).\\nMalpractice insurance premiums average 6 percent of physician practice costs. The average\\npremium masks considerable variation in premiums by specialty and State: Obstetricians and\\nneurologists can pay up to $100,000 or more a year in malpractice insurance premiums in\\nFlorida and New York. Patients who win malpractice cases can receive awards in the millions of\\ndollars.\\nA recent study found that adverse events occurred in slightly less than 4 percent of hospital ad-\\nmissions. Medical negligence caused the adverse event in 25 percent of these cases, or 1 per-\\ncent of all admissions. The incidence of injured patients seeking redress in the courts (8 times\\nas many patients were injured than \\x00iled a claim) or receiving compensation from the courts\\nwas smaller still (16 times as many patients were injured than received compensation). The\\nstudy also found that many malpractice cases in the courts did not involve adverse events or\\nnegligence, and that physicians\\' perceived probability of suit was signi\\x00icantly higher than ac-\\ntual experience warranted (Harvard Medical Study, 1990).\\nInappropriate utilization Studies have documented high variation across geographic areas in\\nthe performance of certain surgical procedures (Wennberg, 1973; Chassin et al., 1986). They\\nraise questions about why this variation, even within small geographic areas, exists: Are pa-\\ntients sicker in some towns than others? Are physicians trained to practice medicine differ-\\nently? In order to measure the extent of this variation, panels of physician experts have devel-\\noped and applied medical appropriateness criterion retrospectively to medical records. They\\nhave found that the incidence of inappropriate use of such expensive and potentially danger-\\nous procedures as coronary artery bypass surgery accounts for between 20 and 35 percent of4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 16/32care (Chassin et al., 1987). Additional RAND Corporation studies of a small number of medical\\nprocedures (Brook et al., 1989; Merrick et al., 1986) found that about 15-30 percent of those\\nmedical procedures were inappropriate, unnecessary, or both, meaning the medical evidence\\ndid not justify the medical intervention. If the estimate for clearly inappropriate procedures\\nalone were applied to all medical spending, this would amount to unnecessary expenditures of\\nbetween $99 billion and $198 billion in 1990. Inappropriate utilization may result from several\\nfactors including incentives inherent in FFS medicine, inadequate communication or knowledge\\namong medical professionals, defensive medicine, and patient demand on physicians to render\\nmore services. As a consequence, the Federal Government is investing more than $100 million\\na year in research to study outcomes and inappropriate utilization, and to develop practice\\nguidelines for physicians.\\nOf course, an unestimated number of people who need appropriate procedures do not receive\\nthem. Groups at risk of underservice include minorities, the poor, and uninsured (Freeman et\\nal., 1987; Hadley, Steinberg, and Feder, 1991; Goldberg et al., 1992). It is unknown whether\\nproviding appropriate procedures to all would result in net savings or costs.\\nDelivery system under stress In many areas of the country, the distribution of providers does\\nnot adequately re\\x00lect the population\\'s need for services. Some inner-city areas have insuf\\x00i-\\ncient physician, clinic, and hospital capacity to provide needed services, resulting in backlogs of\\npatients in emergency rooms which too often serve, inappropriately, as providers of last resort.\\nSome rural areas of the country have excess hospital capacity combined with a paucity of\\nphysicians. In 1988, about 34 million people (collectively 29 percent of the rural population\\nand 9 percent of the urban population) lived in underserved areas (U.S. Of\\x00ice of Technology\\nAssessment, 1990). Other parts of the country have a surfeit of hospital beds and physicians.\\nUtilization review Utilization review techniques are designed to prevent unnecessary services\\nand control costs. They require physicians to \\x00ill out forms, write special justi\\x00ications of the ap-\\npropriateness of the services they order, and subject providers to utilization review of their\\nservices. Medicare peer review activities assess the medical necessity, appropriateness, and\\nquality of care in the hospital setting. Efforts are under way to extend Medicare peer review to\\nother settings (e.g., coordinated care). Some argue that health systems that budget physician\\nexpenditures as a cost-control mechanism grant them more clinical freedom than U.S. physi-\\ncians enjoy. In the United States, physicians guard the right to set their own fees, but as a result\\n\\x00ind themselves increasingly subject to utilization controls which may constrain their clinical\\nfreedom (Reinhardt, 1987).\\nLong-term care In common with other OECD countries, long-term care services in the United\\nStates are not integrated with acute care health services in terms of delivery, providers, or \\x00i-\\nnancing. Because long-term care and acute care are not routinely covered by the same private\\nor social insurance systems (with the exception of Medicaid), there are few incentives to over-\\ncome the separation of services. Social and health services have been effectively integrated in\\nonly a few federally funded demonstration projects in selected cities. Municipal, State, and local\\ngovernments pay for long-term care or home care only in rare and limited cases.\\nReforms in the 1980s4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 17/32When President Reagan took of\\x00ice in 1981, tax reform was a priority. The combination of the\\ntax reforms passed in the early 1980s, and increased military spending during the Reagan\\nPresidency, together with Congress dominated by the opposition party which defended domes-\\ntic program spending, led to a growing Federal de\\x00icit (Sawhill, 1982). In this context, the 1980s\\nwas a decade of constant pressure to \\x00ind budget savings from Medicare and Medicaid because\\nthese programs are not subject to annual budget limits (i.e., spending increases as enrollees\\nutilize services) and they represent a large and rapidly growing share of the Federal domestic\\nbudget.\\nAt the Federal level, the intellectual paradigm to control health costs shifted from regulation\\nand planning to managed competition. Some economists theorize that health care competition\\nis capable of systematically bringing market-oriented economic incentives to bear on medical\\ncare in order to control costs and enhance ef\\x00iciency. These theories suggest that in the face of\\nappropriate incentive forces, health care insurance plans will themselves seek to control both\\nthe price and volume of services as they competitively seek to increase market share and at-\\ntract enrollees (Enthoven, 1978).\\nFederal-level reforms\\nFederal Government reforms have been an opportunistic mix of competitive and regulatory\\nstrategies. The Reagan Administration developed an agenda based on competitive principles in\\nthe early 1980s, but in large measure these proposals were not enacted by Congress. The re-\\nsult was a mixture of pragmatic reforms such as Medicare hospital prospective payment, which\\ncombined aspects of regulation (uniform, Government-set prices) with aspects of competition\\n(per admission payments give hospitals incentives both to attract more patients and to cut\\ncosts).\\nCompetition as a strategy The competitive strategy builds from its critique of the current \\x00i-\\nnancing and delivery system in which the provider has little incentive to contain costs as long\\nas a third-party insurer-payer will honor any bill submitted. The third-party insurer-payer has\\nlittle incentive to pressure providers to control costs if the insured (or his representative, typi-\\ncally an employer) is willing to pay an ever-increasing health insurance premium. The patient\\nhas little incentive to control utilization because with insurance coverage, typically paid by his\\nemployer as a tax-advantaged alternative to taxable wages, the employee-patient is indifferent\\nto costs. Advocates of competition seek to create incentives to overcome such indifference to\\ncosts.\\nThere are various techniques for fostering competition. First, advocates of competition encour-\\nage HMOs and similar entities to compete for members on the basis of quality and premiums\\nas an effective way to control health care in\\x00lation. Because HMOs and similar entities receive a\\n\\x00ixed payment in advance for each enrollee, regardless of actual utilization, they have strong in-\\ncentives to control costs by limiting utilization, whereas the risk of underutilization is moder-\\nated by the entity\\'s need to maintain membership.\\nAnother approach builds on vouchers and tax credits (Pauly et al., 1991, Butler et al., 1989).\\nThese proposals would replace the current open-ended tax subsidy to businesses with income-\\nrelated tax credits for the purchase of health insurance. Low-income families would be given4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 18/32purchasing power in the form of insurance vouchers, allowing them to select among plans\\n(Butler et al., 1989). This would shift the current subsidy away from high-income toward low-\\nincome groups, including low-income workers without employer-sponsored insurance. The\\nButler variation would alter the role of employer groups, making families directly responsible\\nfor the purchase of insurance, using available tax credits. This variation has been criticized be-\\ncause it would end the administrative ef\\x00iciencies provided by large-employer groups. The\\nPauly variation assumes, but does not require, that employers will continue to act as purchas-\\ning agents on behalf of their employees. It has raised concerns that employers might have\\nfewer incentives to negotiate lower group insurance rates on behalf of employees if the ulti-\\nmate purchasing power is shifted to the employee, and that the purchasing power of the tax\\ncredit or voucher might be inadequate for an individual or family without the negotiating\\npower of the employer (Pauly et al., 1991).\\nCompetition proposals Proposals for a tax cap, advanced in the early 1980s by the Reagan\\nAdministration, called for limiting the amount of health insurance an employer could provide\\ntax-free to a \\x00ixed amount per employee per month. The rationale for these proposals is that\\nthe current tax treatment of employer-provided health insurance fuels cost-in\\x00lation because it\\nencourages \\x00irst dollar coverage, excessive utilization, and high provider payment levels by\\nshielding everyone from the true cost of health care choices. Because unlimited health bene\\x00its\\nwould no longer be tax-free, both employees and employers would become more cost-con-\\nscious, and consequently would pressure providers and insurers to contain costs. They also\\nwould be encouraged to seek cost-ef\\x00icient plans, such as HMOs, that are more likely to provide\\nbroad bene\\x00its within the capped tax-free monthly amount. Congress did not agree with the\\nReagan tax cap proposals, and the proposed legislation was never enacted.\\nAnother proposal would have encouraged employers who provide retiree health bene\\x00its sup-\\nplementing Medicare to go at-risk much like an HMO, and manage the basic Medicare bene\\x00it as\\nwell as their supplemental bene\\x00its as a single integrated plan. This was proposed by the\\nAdministration in the mid-1980s as the Medicare voucher bill. Congress subsequently permit-\\nted limited demonstrations of this concept, called Medicare Insured Groups, which are cur-\\nrently under way.\\nMedicare managed care reform In 1982, Congress changed the structure of Medicare pay-\\nments from a retrospectively adjusted cost-reimbursement system to a prospective, risk-based\\none. The goal was to build incentives for HMOs to accept Medicare enrollees, while bringing an\\nelement of competition into the Medicare program. Prior to 1982, Medicare interim payments\\nwere adjusted at the end of the year based on the actual costs incurred by Medicare enrollees.\\nHMO\\'s preferred the post-1982 method where they received a monthly capitated at-risk pay-\\nment for each Medicare enrollee because that is how they insured non-Medicare enrollees.\\nMedicare pays HMOs 95 percent of what it otherwise pays on a geographically adjusted basis\\nfor the average Medicare enrollee in the FFS sector controlling for age, sex, and disability.\\nRegardless of whether the Medicare payment is more or less than an HMO\\'s costs at the end of\\nthe year, there is no further adjustment. This payment method, because it places them at \\x00inan-\\ncial risk, provides HMOs with a strong incentive to contain costs.\\nWith these changes in place, Medicare enrollment in HMOs increased rapidly to a level of about\\n1.5 million enrollees in risk-based HMOs, or 3 percent of total Medicare enrollees. However, for\\ntwo key reasons, growth then leveled off. First, HMOs did not offer suf\\x00icient enrollment incen-\\ntives to entice Medicare bene\\x00iciaries to give up their free choice of providers. Second, HMOs4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 19/32are reluctant to enroll Medicare bene\\x00iciaries in some areas where Medicare payments are\\nconsidered to be too low to make Medicare bene\\x00iciaries good risks. On the other hand, some\\nstudies have shown that Medicare enrollees in HMOs tend to be healthier than Medicare en-\\nrollees in FFS medicine (Mathematica Policy Research, 1989). This phenomenon is called favor-\\nable selection for the HMO and adverse selection for the Medicare program.\\nMedicare hospital payment reform In 1983, the Federal Government adopted a regulatory ap-\\nproach to Medicare hospital payment that changed hospital reimbursement from a cost-based\\nretrospective system, in which a hospital was paid its costs, to a \\x00ixed-price prospective pay-\\nment system (PPS) in order to create incentives for hospitals to be ef\\x00icient in the delivery of\\nservices. Under PPS, hospitals receive an average payment for each patient based upon the\\npatient\\'s diagnosis. If the hospital spends less than the Medicare PPS payment, it keeps the dif-\\nference as pro\\x00it, and if it spends more, it takes a loss. The payment system change was made\\nafter a period in which hospital costs had grown about 16 percent annually. Although PPS is es-\\nsentially a Government administered price system, it was not regarded as incompatible with a\\npro-competitive reform strategy because hospitals, to survive, still had to attract patients. This\\nsigni\\x00icant change in hospital payment resulted primarily from Federal budget pressures and\\nonly secondarily from a consensus within the health policy community about how to reform\\nhospital payments.\\nPPS was successful in reducing Medicare\\'s rate of increase in inpatient hospital spending, and\\nin increasing hospital productivity although the effect on overall cost growth is not clear\\n(Coulam and Gaumer, 1992). A number of State Medicaid programs adopted variations of the\\nPPS in order to reduce their hospital spending. Total hospital spending—inpatient and outpa-\\ntient—still continued to increase because of increased volume of more expensive diagnoses\\n(so-called “upcoding”), and technological change which permitted surgical procedures to move\\nto the outpatient setting. One-half of all surgeries are now performed in the outpatient setting\\nwhere spending controls are less vigorous (American Hospital Association, 1992). Because PPS\\nmakes a payment for each admission, hospitals have incentives to increase admissions.\\nHowever, hospital inpatient admissions declined substantially during the 1980s for all patients.\\nThis decline occurred because of:\\nIncreased review of hospital admissions by both private and public payers.\\nIncreased use of hospital deductibles and coinsurance by private payers.\\nTechnological advances permitting more surgery to be performed in the outpatient setting.\\nThe decline in admissions and days leveled off by the end of the decade.\\nMedicare physician payment reform After the growth rate in Federal hospital expenditures de-\\nclined, attention turned to the 15-percent average annual increase in Medicare physician\\nspending. In 1989, the Medicare system of paying physician charges was changed to a re-\\nsource-based relative value scale (RBRVS) to be phased-in starting in 1992. The prior system\\nof charge-based reimbursement was considered in\\x00lationary because physicians had incentives\\nto raise their charges in order to increase their Medicare payments.\\nRBRVS, like hospital PPS, is regulatory in that it sets a price based on the input resources re-\\nquired to produce each physician service. On the other hand, because physician prices for each\\nprocedure will be published, consumers will have more information about physician costs, fos-4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 20/32tering competition when compared with the old payment system in which it was dif\\x00icult for\\nphysicians or patients to know in advance what Medicare would pay. There are more than\\n7,000 physician procedure codes which must be priced, compared with less than 500 hospital\\npayment groups.\\nAt the same time that the Medicare physician fee schedule was enacted, a process for setting\\nspending goals for Medicare physician services was developed. If physicians exceed the goal,\\nthey can be penalized in a future year by receiving a lower payment update than they other-\\nwise would have received. Conversely, if they meet the goal, they can be rewarded with a larger\\npayment update. In addition, physicians must now submit bills directly to Medicare on behalf of\\npatients (formerly the physician had the right to refuse to submit the bill to Medicare for the\\npatient) and they are restricted in the amount they can charge patients above and beyond what\\nMedicare will pay (balance billing).\\nIt is too early to tell whether the RBRVS will be successful in limiting Medicare physician spend-\\ning. Similarly, it is not yet clear whether private payers will voluntarily adopt the Medicare fee\\nschedule structure, thereby enhancing the prospects for system-wide savings. If RBRVS is\\nbroadly adopted by private payers, the ability of physicians to recoup revenue by increasing\\ncharges to other payers (cost shifting—a dynamic that also applies to hospitals under PPS)\\nwould be signi\\x00icantly reduced.\\nMedicare catastrophic coverage act The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act (MCCA), Public\\nLaw 100-360, enacted in 1988, was the most signi\\x00icant expansion of Medicare bene\\x00its since\\nthe beginning of the program. Prior to MCCA, Medicare patients without supplemental cover-\\nage (i.e., private insurance or Medicaid) were vulnerable to signi\\x00icant out-of-pocket expenses if\\nthey exhausted Medicare hospital coverage or had high outpatient drug or physician expenses.\\nUnder MCCA, Medicare coverage was extended to cover a portion of the costs of outpatient\\nprescription drugs, increasing post-hospital nursing home extended care bene\\x00its, increasing\\nhome health bene\\x00its, limiting bene\\x00iciary cost-sharing liability for covered Medicare services,\\nand expanding inpatient hospital bene\\x00its.\\nMCCA also signi\\x00icantly expanded the Medicaid program by reducing cost sharing for spouses\\nof Medicaid-covered nursing home residents, increasing the number of eligible pregnant\\nwomen and children, and requiring State Medicaid programs to pay Medicare premiums and\\ncost sharing for Medicare bene\\x00iciaries near the poverty line who were not otherwise eligible\\nfor Medicaid.\\nThe new Medicare bene\\x00its were bene\\x00iciary-\\x00inanced, \\x00irst through an increase in Medicare\\nPart B premiums affecting all enrollees, and also through a surcharge on the income taxes of\\nhigh-income elderly. As a result of a tax revolt initiated by high-income bene\\x00iciaries, Medicare\\nprovisions were repealed 1 year after enactment. This experience makes it unlikely that\\nCongress will attempt to pay for expanded bene\\x00its (e.g., long-term care) for the poor elderly\\nby taxing the high-income elderly or reducing their bene\\x00its. It can also be argued that\\nCongress and the President are less likely to propose expanded health bene\\x00its for those with-\\nout insurance coverage paid for by taxing or reducing the bene\\x00its and tax advantages of those\\ncurrently with insurance coverage.4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 21/32Medicaid reform In 1981, the Administration proposed and Congress enacted reductions in\\nMedicaid eligibility coupled with additional State \\x00lexibility in setting payment levels for\\nproviders. States used this new \\x00lexibility to constrain provider payments by engaging in selec-\\ntive contracting with hospitals, developing PPSs similar to Medicare for hospitals, increasing en-\\nrollment in managed care networks, and restricting rates of increase in payments to all\\nproviders. By the end of the decade, hospitals were challenging the adequacy of Medicaid pay-\\nment levels in the courts arguing that States had violated the statutory requirement to set pay-\\nment rates high enough to cover the costs of an ef\\x00iciently run hospital. In some cases, the\\ncourts have ruled that States have presented insuf\\x00icient evidence to justify their payment lev-\\nels (U.S. Congressional Budget Of\\x00ice, 1992). As a result, some States have begun to increase\\ntheir Medicaid payments to hospitals.\\nAlthough budget cutting goals continued to be the norm for the fast-growing Medicare pro-\\ngram throughout the 1980s, during the second half of the 1980s, Congress began to expand\\nthe number of people eligible for Medicaid resulting in dramatically increased spending. The\\nexpanded Federal mandates meant that States were required to devote new resources to\\nMedicaid. By the end of the decade, Medicaid was the fastest-growing component of State bud-\\ngets. Given the recent recession and consequent declines in State revenues, States are now\\nhighly resistant to additional Medicaid expansions absent their full \\x00inancing by the Federal\\nGovernment.\\nState-level reforms\\nAll-payer systems In the 1970s and 1980s, several States, including Maryland, New Jersey, New\\nYork, and Massachusetts, started all-payer ratesetting systems for hospital services. Ratesetting\\nis a regulatory method of budgeting hospitals designed to provide adequate revenue for all pa-\\ntients, including those without insurance, prevent cost shifting between payers, and provide in-\\ncentives for cost containment. These systems budget hospitals either by establishing payment\\nrates for the treatment of each patient as in PPS, no matter who pays (hence the term all-\\npayer), or by directly establishing annual budgets. Evaluations indicate that all-payer rateset-\\nting has been a successful cost-control strategy (Anderson, 1992). The rate of hospital cost\\ngrowth has been reduced on a per capita basis compared with the national average. Most of\\nthe ratesetting States started with comparatively higher hospital costs, making it unclear\\nwhether or not these savings would have resulted if the system were adopted in States with\\nlower costs. Despite their success in cost control, all-payer ratesetting programs have not been\\nadopted by additional States. All-payer systems require consensus among health insurers, em-\\nployers, hospitals, and State government as well as a sophisticated State regulatory bureau-\\ncracy. Some States reject as inappropriate such signi\\x00icant State intervention in the health\\nmarketplace.\\nEmployer health insurance mandates Prior to the 1980s, Hawaii adopted an employer health\\ninsurance mandate and has virtually universal coverage. However, the passage of ERISA (previ-\\nously discussed) prevents additional States from requiring employers to provide insurance.\\nEmployer mandates have not resulted in signi\\x00icant problems in Hawaii for a variety of rea-\\nsons, including a history of employer paternalism (employer-provided health bene\\x00its were\\nwidespread prior to the State mandate), and the State\\'s geographic isolation that prevents em-4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 22/32ployers and health care providers from easily moving to a different State. In addition, the State\\nhas a fast-growing economy which increases employer competition for relatively scarce labor\\n(Friedman, 1990; Van Ellet, 1981).\\nThe State of Massachusetts adopted a variant of an employer mandate called play or pay.\\nUnder play or pay, an employer must provide health insurance to employees or pay a tax which\\nis used by the State to provide public insurance for the \\x00irm\\'s employees and other uninsured\\nindividuals. However, the Massachusetts play or pay plan was not implemented because of the\\nState\\'s recent \\x00iscal crises, and election of a new governor who campaigned, in part, on a plat-\\nform opposing the program (Kronick, 1991).\\nRisk pools for the uninsurable Twenty-\\x00ive States have legislatively approved risk-pool legisla-\\ntion to provide insurance to those who, because of an expensive pre-existing health condition,\\ncannot purchase insurance in the private market. Generally, risk pools are \\x00inanced by a mix-\\nture of State general revenues, health insurance premium taxes, and individual premiums.\\nSeveral States have actually implemented such pools. However, because risk-pool premiums are\\nhigh (even though insuf\\x00icient on an actuarial basis)—typically 125 to 150 percent of equiva-\\nlent policies—m any of the uninsurable cannot afford to participate. Consequently, these pools\\nhave limited enrollments, but require substantial subsidies, nonetheless. Enrollment in State\\nrisk pools ranges from 94 people in Wyoming to 25,000 in Minnesota (Trippler, 1991).\\nOregon health priorities demonstration In order to increase the number of people with health\\ninsurance, the State of Oregon has proposed a three-part program (Eddy, 1991). First, it pro-\\nposes to expand Medicaid eligibility to all persons below the poverty line, whether or not they\\nare categorically eligible, and to partly \\x00inance these expansions in health insurance coverage\\nby not paying for medical services that are determined annually by the legislature to be of low\\npriority. Oregon constructed a partial enumeration of health services. Based on available medi-\\ncal information and on the values expressed by Oregonians toward those outcomes, as as-\\nsessed through public forums and surveys, 709 pairs of conditions and treatments were\\nranked from most- to least-expected positive outcomes.\\nThe annual Medicaid budget will determine how far down the list services can be funded in any\\ngiven year. Only mothers and children would be covered under the demonstration\\'s \\x00irst year,\\nand the elderly and disabled populations would be phased in at a later date. This policy has\\nbeen described as rationing, and criticized as funding expansions for one group of the poor at\\nthe expense of another. However, it has been defended as achieving greater equity among the\\npoor by giving a smaller but higher priority bene\\x00it package to a larger group of people, and al-\\nlowing explicit public participation in publicly funded health insurance choices. Because of the\\nnature of the changes to the Medicaid program, Federal approval of the demonstration is re-\\nquired before it can be implemented. To date, approval has not been given.\\nIn addition to the Medicaid changes, the Oregon proposal includes two other components. It\\nwould require employers, on a play or pay basis, to extend insurance coverage to employees\\nnot currently insured; and, it would allow low-income people not covered by the employer\\nmandate or Medicaid to purchase publicly-subsidized State-sponsored insurance.\\nPrivate sector reforms4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 23/32In recent years, employers and private insurers have used a number of strategies to control\\nhealth-care costs. These include the development of coordinated care networks, such as HMOs\\nand PPOs, previously noted, increases in employee cost sharing, and the employment of a vari-\\nety of utilization review techniques. All of these approaches are designed to decrease utiliza-\\ntion of health care services thought to have marginal value to the individual case.\\nAnother cost-control strategy that many large employers use is to self-insure, paying for em-\\nployee health expenses rather than purchasing a health insurance policy from an insurance\\ncompany. Under ERISA, employers who self-insure escape State regulations, including man-\\ndated bene\\x00its and taxes on premiums. Some self-insured companies have placed limits (for ex-\\nample, $5,000) on payments for speci\\x00ic conditions such as AIDS. This has been challenged in\\nthe courts (McGann v. H and H Music Co., 1991). Self-insuring employers also avoid the pro\\x00it,\\nmarketing, and sales components of private health insurance policies, and reserve for them-\\nselves the \\x00inancial bene\\x00its which other insurers secure through investment of premiums and\\nreserves. Such employers may contract with a health insurer for claims processing services\\nonly. More than one-half of all group insurance company coverage is now provided by self-in-\\nsurance (Health Insurance Association of America, 1991).\\nDespite all of these efforts, employers may \\x00ind that offering a coordinated care product (PPO\\nor HMO) as a choice to the employee group may not reduce overall costs. Although healthy em-\\nployees opt for the coordinated care network (which they do not expect to use) to obtain\\nlower premiums, the premium for the employer\\'s traditional indemnity plan is driven up by the\\nsicker risk pool that remains in the FFS sector. One recent study of a PPO found that enrollees\\nused it for preventive care and minor illnesses, but went outside the network about one-half\\nthe time for specialty care and hospitalization without surgery (Wouters and Hester, 1988).\\nThis suggests a dilemma for public policy in relation to encouraging PPOs: If the price for going\\noutside the network is not punitive, enrollees will go outside for much of their care. However, if\\nthe price is punitive, the plan may no longer be attractive to enrollees.\\nHealth-system reform\\nBy the early 1990s, continued large premium increases in the small group health insurance\\nmarket led to increasing recognition that reforms were needed at the State or National level.\\nThe heavy use of medical underwriting by small group insurers combined with such practices\\nas increasing premium rates when illnesses occurred meant that many companies faced the\\nchoice of dropping coverage, excluding employees with medical conditions from their policies,\\nor shopping for a new insurer in an ever-tightening and expensive market.\\nDespite pressure for fundamental reform in recent years, major changes in the U.S. health care\\nsystem have not occurred for several reasons: 1) no consensus has yet emerged on the direc-\\ntion fundamental reform should take; 2) there is divided political control of the Administration\\nand Congress; 3) budget pressures at both the Federal and State levels make it unlikely that\\nthere will be substantial new money to \\x00inance reforms; 4) the public is unhappy with the\\nhealth system as a whole but satis\\x00ied with their own doctor; and 5) the public is unwilling to\\npay more than a small amount in new taxes to \\x00inance changes (Blendon and Edwards, 1991;\\nBlendon and Donelan, 1990).44/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 24/32Health has emerged as an important issue in the 1992 election. Candidates and all the major in-\\nterest groups have advanced proposals, and bills have been introduced in Congress. The\\nRepublican Party tends to support voluntary market-based proposals and the Democratic\\nParty tends to support mandatory government-directed proposals, but there are still signi\\x00icant\\ndifferences within each party. Proposals tend to differ on one or more of several dimensions:\\nthe extent to which they rely on the private sector or government to provide health insurance\\ncoverage; whether they call for cost control through market forces, government ratesetting, or\\ngovernment-determined budgets; and whether they are universal and mandatory, or voluntary\\nand incentive-based.\\nIt is an open question whether the country will unite behind any of the broad-scale proposals\\noutlined later, or support incremental changes to components of the current system.\\nPresident Bush\\'s proposal President Bush has advanced a broad, market-based reform ap-\\nproach that builds on the present health care delivery system (Executive Of\\x00ice of the\\nPresident, 1992). The plan minimizes the role of Government in providing health insurance in\\nfavor of providing individuals with tax credits for the purchase of private insurance but also\\ncontains regulatory aspects. The plan has numerous elements. It would:\\nProvide health insurance tax credits to the poor for the purchase of private insurance.\\nIncrease tax subsidies to the middle class for the purchase of insurance.\\nRegulate the ability of private insurers to select whom to insure and how much to charge.\\nEncourage the growth of coordinated care in public and private programs.\\nReduce administrative costs in public and private programs.\\nReform the medical liability system.\\nExpand access to services in underserved areas by increasing funding for public health\\nclinics and health personnel.\\nAdvantages of the proposal include that it builds on the current system, which minimizes dis-\\nruption for those who are satis\\x00ied with their current arrangements, and allows those newly\\nenfranchised with a tax credit or otherwise assisted in purchasing health care coverage to\\nchoose their health insurance plan. However, critics argue that the proposal does not guaran-\\ntee universal coverage, and hence the problems surrounding the uninsured will not be fully re-\\nmediated. They also assert that market incentives and managed care approaches will not ade-\\nquately control costs.\\nEmployer-based proposals Some members of the Democratic Party have endorsed play or pay.\\nThis type of proposal requires employers to provide a minimum health insurance package or\\npay a tax to support public provision of coverage to their employees. Variations, such as the\\nproposal of the National Leadership Coalition, include an overall health budget target, set by a\\nquasi-governmental board, which would constrain real growth in health spending, over time, to\\nthe growth in the gross national product (National Leadership Coalition for Health Care\\nReform, 1991).\\nPlay or pay proposals address the problem of self-selection by allowing employers to choose\\nbetween provision of insurance or payment of the tax. Employers facing high health insurance\\nexpenses may save money by paying the tax, while those with low health expenses may save\\nmoney by purchasing insurance. The public plan could become very expensive if private insur-4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 25/32ance covers low-cost employer groups, leaving high-cost groups to the public plan. The play or\\npay approach differs from an employer mandate primarily by having a back-up public plan that\\nwould shift signi\\x00icant dollars from the private to the public sector. However, this back-up pub-\\nlic plan could potentially include all of the uninsured, while an employer mandate, by itself,\\nwould leave uncovered the 25 percent of the uninsured who are not connected to the labor\\nforce.\\nAdvantages of employer-based approaches (either a mandate or play or pay) include expand-\\ning, rather than replacing, the current employer-based insurance system to uncovered workers\\nthereby reducing the current problem of cost shifting. When compared with government-spon-\\nsored national health insurance, employer-based proposals limit the costs shifted to public\\nbudgets. However, critics argue that employer-based approaches will increase unemployment\\nas employers, particularly small businesses, are forced to lay off workers because they cannot\\nor choose not to incur the tax or the cost of health insurance. They also characterize mandated\\ncoverage as a tax on employers and employees. Critics of play or pay argue that the public plan\\nwould be unstable, grow rapidly, and likely would evolve into national health insurance (Butler,\\n1991).\\nGovernment-sponsored national health insurance Advocates of publicly \\x00inanced or budgeted\\napproaches, which include some members of the Democratic Party, are split between two pos-\\nsible versions: the Canadian or State-budgeted model, and the Medicare or federally budgeted\\nmodel. Arguments for the Federal model are that a global budget and a single payer would be\\nthe most ef\\x00icient in reducing duplicative administrative costs, negotiating payment levels with\\nhealth providers, and assuring universal coverage (Himmelstein and Woolhandler, 1989).\\nProponents for the State model argue that State budgets are constrained by the inability to run\\nde\\x00icits or print money, so States may have a greater stake in restraining cost growth than the\\nFederal Government. In addition, consolidating health programs at the State level would build\\non existing State functions such as licensing providers and inspecting health facilities.\\nOpponents argue that national health insurance would lead to burdensome regulation, ra-\\ntioning, and objectionable new taxes.\\nRecent blue ribbon commission proposals Several recent Commissions have examined the\\nquestion of universal health insurance coverage and cost control. These include the Pepper\\nCommission (a bipartisan group representing Congress, the Administration, and the public),\\nthe Quadrennial Social Security Advisory Commission, the National Governors\\' Association\\n(NGA), and the National Leadership Coalition for Health Care Reform (1991), a group of big\\nbusiness, unions, consumers, and health care professionals. The Quadrennial Commission rec-\\nommended a series of demonstrations in the States prior to fundamental reform at the Federal\\nlevel (Advisory Council on Social Security, 1991). NGA recommended federalizing the long-term\\ncare portion of Medicaid and allowing States to engage in demonstrations, such as Hawaii\\'s em-\\nployer mandate and Maryland\\'s all-payer system. The Pepper Commission (U.S. Bipartisan\\nCommission, 1990) and the National Leadership Coalition (1991) recommended variations on\\nan employer-based play or pay approach.\\nSummary and conclusion4/17/24, 8:08 PM A layman\\'s guide to the U.S. health care system - PMC\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193322/ 26/32As of this writing, December 1992, it appears that the new Administration\\'s approach to na-\\ntional health reform will build upon the existing employer- sponsored health insurance system.\\nIt is unclear, however, how universal coverage will be achieved or costs controlled.

The Money Flow From Household to Health Care Providers  (2011)\\nHospital and Physician Financing\\nPublic and private hospitals receive payment from both public and private \\x00nancing\\nsources. Hospitals are typically paid through a diagnostic-related group (DRG), which\\nassigns a set payment amount for a particular condition or treatment sequence.\\nInpatient DRGs are widely used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\\nand by many private payers as a payment scheme for hospitals. Rather than paying the\\nhospital for a line-item list of procedures and medications, Medicare pays the hospital a\\n\\x00xed amount based on the DRG, regardless of the actual cost of treatment. The DRG-\\nbased payments cover accommodation costs in a hospital (ie, room and board, facility\\ncosts, etc), procedure costs, support sta\\x00 (nurses, technicians, etc), and drug/medical\\ndevice costs; however, this system does not include physician fees. In the outpatient\\nsetting, Ambulatory Payment Classi\\x00cation (APC) codes are used by the hospital system\\nfor billing and reimbursement. These APC codes represent a fee-for-service style of\\nbilling, rather than the capitated, cost-based style of DRGs.4\\n54/17/24, 8:07 PM ISPOR - US Healthcare System Overview-Background\\nhttps://www.ispor.org/heor-resources/more-heor-resources/us-healthcare-system-overview/us-healthcare-system-overview-background-page-1 3/3Physician fees are not included within DRG (inpatient) or APC (outpatient) codes. When\\nbilling for physicians and other clinician fees, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)\\ncodes are used and are billed under the name of the provider rather than the hospital.\\nCPT codes may be used in both the inpatient and outpatient settings and are indicative\\nof a fee-for-service healthcare reimbursement structure.\\nPrivate insurers pay hospitals based on DRGs, case rates, per diems, fee-for-service,\\nand/or discounted fee-for-service schemes. On average, these payments exceed the\\nhospital’s costs of providing the underlying services. Conversely, hospitals, on average,\\nare reimbursed less than the costs of services for Medicare, Medicaid, and uninsured\\npatients.\\n<< Back (/heor-resources/more-heor-resources/us-healthcare-system-overview)| Next\\n>> (/heor-resources/more-heor-resources/us-healthcare-system-overview/us-\\nhealthcare-system-overview-background-page-2)\\nThe Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research\\nCopyright © 2024ISPOR.
